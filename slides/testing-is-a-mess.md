##  Testing is a Mess

For every framework there are as many testing libraries.

* Unit testing is extremely difficult.
* Feature testing is extremely difficult.
* Integration testing is extremely difficult.
* Automatic testing is extremely difficult.

note:
    Testing is super important.  It enforces good, modular code that can be
    assured of high quality and has high likelihood of being bug free.
    Yet the JavaScript world has several different testing frameworks that
    all seem incredible difficult to integrate into a JavaScript project.
