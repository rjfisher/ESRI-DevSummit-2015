##  Vector Tiles

Raster is like *soooo* 2005.

* Increased map fidelity
* Increased map functionality
* Decreased tile size

note:
    * Vector data looks good at any scale.
    * Vector data allows for dynamic labeling
    * Vector allows for map rotation w/o losing labeling
    * Vector allows for severely smaller cache sizes

    * Requires **ArcPro**
