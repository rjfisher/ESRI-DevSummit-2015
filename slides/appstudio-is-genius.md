##  AppStudio is Genius

* Supports every platform we care about.
  * Windows Desktop/Phone
  * Mac & Linux
  * Android
  * iOS
* Build /beta process passed off to `ESRI`
* Compiles to **native** UI components
* Speed of native applications.

note:
  AppStudio appears to be awesome.  Require learning QT and the limitations
  of the various platforms.  Plus is difficult to design UI for all platforms.
  Yet compiles code written once into native libraries to create native apps.
  This feels like the best option thus far for true cross platform support.
