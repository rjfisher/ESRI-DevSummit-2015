##  Develop Once, Deploy Everywhere

ESRI is investing heavily in cross platform tooling.

* Xamarin for C# cross-platform mobile code.
* Qt for true, complete platform agnosticism.

note:
    * Thing is called AppStudio
    * Nothing is **truly** cross-platform
    * UI changes for device size/orientation matter
    * Some versions will suffer.
    * Built w/ ESRI Online
