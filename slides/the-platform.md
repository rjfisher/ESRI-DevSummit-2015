| ArcGIS Desktop | ArcGIS Apps | ArcGIS APIs |
| :------------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| Desktop | Mobile | Native APIs |

*All of this powered by ArcGIS Server!!*

note:
    * ESRI is pushing to get as much buy-in to their ecosystem as possible.
    * Considered two system: server supports portal which servers data to apps.
    * "Portal" is really ESRI Online
    * "Portal" is built on organizations/users paradigm
    * Everything within ESRI is pushing toward this architecture
    * Buy into the Platform or die.
