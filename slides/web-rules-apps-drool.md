##  Web Rules, Apps Drool

`ESRI` is attempting feature parity across all APIs but the focus is on the web.
The introduction of ESRI Online insures that the JavaScript API will have the
focus of `ESRI's` attention going forward.

note:
    * Desktop and mobile APIs exist.  JavaScript is where it's at.
    * JavaScript has 3d and offline support.
    * ESRI devs are integrating JavaScript API w/ new web technology.

    * Silverlight & Flash didn't exist at the conference.
    * ArcObjects was equally nonexistent.
    * ArcPro SDK was barely featured either.
    * Integration with ESRI Online is the current focus.
