##  Apps

Enabling users to create *applications* rather than simply *content*.

`ESRI` is giving users powerful tools for users.

* Web App Templates
* Web App Builder

note:
    * No longer just for developers
    * Allows users to customize complex templates to create a true application
    * Allows users to create complex apps using widgets via web app builder
    * Tools are there for GIS Admin to create workflows for his users w/o needing
    to know how to code.
    * Opportunities for us to leverage this technology ourselves for quick development
    * Opportunities for us to leverage this technology to create profitable
    templates/widgets
    * This will eat more and more into custom application development.
